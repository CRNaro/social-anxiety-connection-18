## Description
The `social-anxiety-connection-18` is a social network API designed to allow users to share thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and manage a friend list efficiently. Built with MongoDB for its flexibility with large amounts of unstructured data and Express.js for routing, this project demonstrates a powerful backend setup that can handle the dynamic needs of a modern social network platform.

## Usage
To use the social network API, users can perform various actions such as creating, updating, and deleting user profiles and thoughts, adding and removing friends, and posting reactions to thoughts. This API serves as the backend foundation for a social media startup aiming to manage large amounts of unstructured data seamlessly.
